I am currently a second year Ph.D student in the Department of Materials Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Prof. Kristin Persson. 
My research focused on developing methods to understand the evolution of solid-electrolyte interphase(SEI) and cathode-electrolyte interphase(CEI) in Li-ion batteries using computational methods. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked in the Credit Fraud Data Science Team in PayPal, Chennai, India as a Machine Learning Scientist from 2021 to 2023. I received my B.Tech in Metallurgical & Materials Engineering and M.Tech in Computational Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras in 2021.
